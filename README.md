# ACDRpcap2wav Audio Extraction

A tool for extracting audio streams from AudioCodes debug recordings in pcap files. This utility uses `tshark` to parse the capture file, isolates RTP payloads associated with AudioCodes Full Session IDs (as seen in syslogs), and converts them to WAV audio files for analysis.

---

## Overview

The ACDRpcap2wav tool automates the process of:
- Filtering pcap files by AudioCodes Full Session ID.
- Extracting RTP payloads based on session parameters.
- Converting μ-law encoded audio to linear PCM.
- Saving the resulting audio as WAV files in an organized directory structure.

Users can target a specific AudioCodes session (using the full session ID found in syslogs) or process all available sessions in the pcap.

## Requirements

- **Python 3.7+**
- **Wireshark/tshark**  
  The script checks for `tshark` in common installation paths:
  - Windows:  
    - `C:\Program Files\Wireshark\tshark.exe`
    - `C:\Program Files (x86)\Wireshark\tshark.exe`
  - Linux:  
    - `/usr/bin/tshark`
    - `/usr/local/bin/tshark`
  - macOS:  
    - `/Applications/Wireshark.app/Contents/MacOS/tshark`
- **AudioCodes Debug Recording**
  - Pcap file that includes AudiocCodes Debug Recording traffic.
  - Models supported:
    - AudioCodes MP114 or MP118
    - Audiocodes M1K or M1KB
    - AudioCodes M800
- Python modules: `sys`, `subprocess`, `binascii`, `wave`, `time`, `audioop`, and `pathlib`.

> **Note:** The `audioop` module is deprecated in Python 3.11. Consider alternatives if using newer Python versions.

## Usage

Run the script from the command line, providing the path to your pcap file:

```bash
python acdrpcap2wav.py /path/to/your/capture.pcapng
```
You will be prompted to enter an AudioCodes Session ID:

Enter a specific session ID (e.g., ccfc41:27) to extract audio for that session.

Leave the input blank to process all sessions found in the pcap.

Extracted audio files are saved in an ACDR-Audio directory created in the same folder as the pcap file. Each session is stored in a subfolder (with colons replaced by periods), and each stream is saved as a WAV file named using its rtp.ssrc and a descriptive trace point.
